<h1>Samurai Armour, Katana, Sabre and more epoch defining weapons and armours, all in one! </h1>

* JSON modified to align with all the animation overhauls in-game for Vintage story 1.19.x game update. 
* The messed up weapon hitbox and unresponsive player animations are now fixed to be responsive and accurate. 
* Seax now properly works as a weapon as well - bugged in 1.18 onwards.
* Steel and steel tier armours are now registered correctly in their appropriate tier
* Some weapons attack numbers rebalanced (E.g: Sabre, Katana, battle-axe) based on historical recreation readings and player in-game feedback
* Proper directory structure for storing the appropriate tools and items 
* The code for deliberately slowing down the mace is removed in this release to retain parity with in-game mace speeds of recent game releases.

<h3> Upcomimg </h3>
